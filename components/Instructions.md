### Job Description: Components Folder

#### The components folder contains reusable UI elements used throughout the app. Each file represents a self-contained piece of the interface (like buttons, cards, modals, etc.), making the code more modular, maintainable, and easier to test or update. Components are typically presentational and receive data via props.
