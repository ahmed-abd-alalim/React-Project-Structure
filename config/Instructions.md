### Job Description: Config Folder

#### The config folder stores configuration settings and constants used across the application. This includes API base URLs, environment-specific variables, theme settings, third-party service keys, and other global values. Centralizing these settings improves maintainability, scalability, and environment switching (e.g., dev, staging, production).
